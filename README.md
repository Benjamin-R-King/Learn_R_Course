# Learn_R_Course

I taught this workshop twice for Genspace (https://www.genspace.org/)

This repository has all the of the Slides, help documents, example datasets, and example code that was used in this course.

A good place to start is to download and install R and RStudio (reference "Install R and RStudio.docx")

Next, work through the day 1 and day 2 slides in the .PDFs

Example data sets and .R code will be referenced in the slides and you can explore those in RStudio
